Installation instructions for WMNUT.

Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------
  WMNUT requires the:

	* X Window client and Xpm libraries and development files
	* NUT client library (www.networkupstools.org), version 2.2.1
	  or higher

  In order to compile WMNUT using the Makefile, GNU make must
be used (FreeBSD users, the default BSD 'make' does not work,
so use gmake instead).

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------

1) % tar -zxvf wmnut-X.YZ.tar.gz
or % tar -jxvf wmnut-X.YZ.tar.bz2

2) % cd wmnut-X.YZ/

3) % ./configure

Note that you can force NUT library files path by using
"--with-nut-libs" and "--with-nut-includes" or only "--with-nut"
to indicate the respective directories of upsclient.o and
upsclient.h.

4) % make (or gmake on most *BSD systems)

5) % make install (must be root) or simply copy binary (and
	optionally the man page) to a directory in your path.

6) (Optional) edit and tune (if needed) wmnutrc, then copy
   it to your home or/and etc directory :
   % cp wmnutrc /etc/wmnutrc
	or / and 
   % cp wmnutrc ~/.wmnutrc

Notes: 
- if both files exist, "~/.wmnutrc" takes precedence.
- command lines options takes precedence on above files.
- on debian, wmnutrc is located in /usr/share/doc/wmnut/

7) % wmnut & (or 'wmnut -h' for help, or 'man wmnut' for the man page)
If no parameter is given, wmnut will try to access the UPS at
"localhost" address ; otherwise try "wmnut -U upsname@hostname" or
edit your wmnutrc files.

Be sure to read the HINTS and TODO files too!
